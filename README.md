SPFullCalendar
==============

This is a custom CSR for SharePoint 2013 to render an external list using the FullCalendar plugin for jQuery. You will need to change the following things to match your environment:

1) The path to the FullCalendar distribution (lines 8, 10, 12, & 14)

2) The name of the external list (line 44)

3) The column names for the start and end dates (line 44)
